# Changelog

## Methodology

- We are versioning according to [semver.org](https://semver.org)
- We are currently in the ["Initial development phase"](https://semver.org/#spec-item-4)

## 0.8.0

- (breaking) Double it-length-prefixed length
- Fixes in reconciliation algorithm

**Caution:** If you're running a node and you must preserve its reconciliation
data, it is best get in touch with us directly via Telegram. If you can afford
to just delete the reconciliation data and start over, we suggest you do this.

## 0.7.0

- (breaking) Fixed a bug in the constraints metadata db. Details:
  https://github.com/attestate/kiwistand/commit/37ba938a811b39ec6e88887eaa278d393b72ff6b
  **Caution:** If you're running a node, read this carefully and potentially
  get in touch!
- Hardcode mainnet mints to preserve mainnet timestamps of minting
- Optimism mint crawler records timestamps of mints
- Mints can now be tracked separately
- Many frontend updates

## 0.6.0

- Upgrade all libp2p version identifiers
- Move all eligible-defining NFTs to `oeth:0x66747bdc903d17c586fa09ee5d6b54cc85bbea45`
- Deprecate `RPC_HTTP_HOST`
- Fix bugs with indexing logs. attestate/crawler `order` function was ordering
  logs based on blockIndex and transactionIndex, but logIndex was necessary
  too.
  - We've essentially created two new indexing strategies
    ("list-delegations-2", and "op-call-block-logs").
- store.posts now tolerates finding "in-eligible" messages
- Added docs that explain how Kiwi News Protocol's set reconciliation works
- Use a DFS to traverse the tree for posts (thank you to @freeatnet!)

## 0.5.0

- Deactivate revocations temporarily until we're properly implementing them in
  the set reconciliation algorithm. [Details](https://github.com/attestate/kiwistand/commit/71899f89d53809e9d17929c70d0935b08c3e21dc#diff-a769d9b90a5ba7d598420c1d02fc67325bd17e2d193747d5033fa52ee1e7d28eR15-R30).
- Upgrade all protocol major versions.

## 0.4.0

- Require new environment variable `OPTIMISM_RPC_HTTP_HOST`
- Website: Minor stylistic changes
- Protocol:
  - All semantic version identifiers have been upgraded as a major version to
    avoid name collisions with nodes running older versions of this software.
- API
  - POST /api/v1/list endpoint now adds two new properties to a message
    `identity` and `signer`.
  - POST /api/v1/messages now accepts messages signed from a delegate address.
- Docs
  - Document difference in ports between API and frontend

## 0.3.0

- Environment Variables
  - Rename `TIMESTAMP_TOLERANCE_SECS` to `MAX_TIMESTAMP_DELTA_SECS`
  - Separate `HTTP_PORT` (for website) and `API_PORT` (for node API)
  - Remove all `TODAYS_EDITOR_...` variables
- Add Sphinx docs
- Many changes to the frontend (won't list details)
- Separated website frontend from node API frontend. They now run on differnet
  ports.
- The allowlist registry now guarantees returning a set of unique Ethereum
  addresses.
- The level's remote comparisons are now validated at the receiving node with a
  JSON schema.
- For the frontend (mainly), ecrecover can now cache recovering signatures.
- Logging of errors in the reconciliation algorithm has been improved.
- The "leaves" function can now be called with a "startDatetime" parameter to
  speed up database queries.
- Database migration
  - This release contains an incompatible database migration from earlier
    releases! If you actually need to migrate from 0.2.0 to 0.3.0, contact
    @timdaub!
  - LMDB now uses "ordered-binary" key encoding to enable range based key
    queries.
  - Our message hashing and identity generation was broken and so messages
    weren't canonically hashed. This had to be addressed in a database
    migration and by fixing the canonicalization. Again, if you really must
    migrate your data, make sure to contact us beforehand!
  - We enabled "useNodePruning" in ethereumjs/trie (this gets rid of deleted
    nodes).
- Protocols
  - Upgrade "leaves" protocol to v3.0.0
  - Improve PMT traversal algorithm that had a bug when branching factor was
    too big (vendored in WalkController from ethereumjs/trie).
  - Improved atomic committments of data entry within set reconciliation. Made
    both metadb and trie transactional.

## 0.2.0

- We discovered a critical issue in the v0.1.0 code base that lead to digests
  of messages in the ordering algorithm to be non-canonical [1] (thanks
  @freeatnet).
- We're fixing this using npm:canonicalize that implements
  [RFC8785](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8785) for canonical JSON.
- Since we already had nodes in the network with existing data we shipped our
  first migration too. It checks for the digest algorithm, and applies a
  migration accordingly. **We strongly recommend doing a backup of the
  `DATA_DIR` before applying the v0.2.0 update.**
- To avoid synchronizations between v0.1.0 nodes and v0.2.0 nodes, we upgraded
  all protocol and pubsub identifiers and versions too to avoid corrupting data
  bases.
