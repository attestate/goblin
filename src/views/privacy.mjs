                  <h2>Data Sharing:</h2>
                  <p>
                    We use service providers that may have access to parts of
                    the data: Hetzner, Google Analytics, Buttondown.email, and
                    Zora. Data transfers to third countries such as the United
                    States are done under the legal basis of Standard
                    Contractual Clauses.

                  <h2>Data Retention:</h2>
                  <p>
                    EIP712 messages are potentially available indefinitely in
                    our p2p network and are public. A set reconciliation
                    algorithm replaces them across a number of nodes. Deletion
                    of these messages is not possible.
                  </p>
                  <h2>User Rights:</h2>
                  <p>
                    All users have access to the stories and upvotes submitted
                    via the p2p network through the respective APIs. Users
                    cannot delete or modify data once it's submitted to the p2p
                    network. For exercising rights related to data processed by
                    our service providers, users should contact the respective
                    providers directly.
                  </p>
                  <h2>Security Measures:</h2>
                  <p>
                    We implement industry-standard security measures to protect
                    user data.
                  </p>
