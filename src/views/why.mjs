                      Reaching new people on the Internet is hard. So is finding
                      great, non-mainstream quality content.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      As social media became the principal tool for distributing
                      content, creators with fewer than 10k followers face an
                      uphill battle to be noticed, even if their work is
                      extraordinary.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      It's especially true in web3 where Hacker News - once a
                      leading forum for intellectual exchange - has become
                      openly hostile towards crypto. Creators are thus relegated
                      to sharing their content through Discord, Telegram, and
                      various social media channels, praying that by a stroke of
                      luck, someone will notice their work.

                      On the other hand, if you are a reader looking for great
                      things, you need to check noisy social media newsfeeds and
                      group chats, hoping to find the content needle in the
                      haystack of unrelated posts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      That's why we created Kiwi News - to help both creators
                      and readers.
                    </p>

                      For creators we provide a platform that levels the playing
                      field and helps them to be heard. Even when their content
                      is not shared by the most popular kids in the room. Kiwi
                      readers on the other hand can now take a look at the
                      community-curated links and uncover hidden gems in 5
                      minutes, instead of digging on different social media for
                      hours.
